They melt in your mouth so fast and you're still left with a full feeling and chocolatey taste.\n\nYou can also choose not to add the chocolate chunks. It's really delicious. I made like 5-6 different batches and variations of this recipe.\n\nBUT WHATEVER YOU DO AT LEAST USE ALUMINUM FOIL!\n\nIf you try just using butter or oil to coat the pan, it will cause the outside crust to sort of caramelize and it may end up sticking to the pan.\n\n1 batch didn't stick but was hard to get out, then I got 2 batches that ended up sticking. I also burnt 2 batches because they were thinly laid in the pan and I left them in there the max amount of time.\n\nSo this recipe is fun but can be tricky if you have to adjust ingredients or don't have aluminum foil at minimum.",

I just thought it would be fun to bake as it looked easy and it was! ONE THING I DONT LIKE, it was WAYY TOO SWEET [according to my parents] but for me it was not that bad, i guess? Maybe because I have a sweet tooth. My dad said its insane to put that much sugar I'll definitely bake these next time but less sugar. My whole packet of sugar literally is gone now because too much sugar, I had to mix it with castor sugar that I had because I ran out of granulated.\n\nThe brownies reached my expectations. Crinkly, fudgy, chewy and on the inside is gooey with chocolate melts. Highly recommend.",

WHAT A DIFFERENCE.\n\nThat said, from someone who hates coffee, espresso powder absolutely makes things taste like coffee to non-coffee drinkers. Those brownies have been ruined.\n\nI love your show and came on here for tips before I bake brownies tonight in my tiny kitchen.",
