This is for a class project, however, I wanted to advocate for the deaf community and let you know that having closed captions can be extremely helpful when it comes to watching videos, as they can allow for the viewer to better understand what is being said whenever a word is not understood by the automated captions. \nI love your videos and I'm sure that many people in the deaf community also, as your recipes are extremely delicious (have tested and tasted many of them).

It's really delicious. I made like 5-6 different batches and variations of this recipe.\n\nBUT WHATEVER YOU DO AT LEAST USE ALUMINUM FOIL!\n\nif you try just using butter or oil to coat the pan, it will cause the outside crust to sort of caramelize and it may end up sticking to the pan.",

Maybe because I have a sweet tooth. My dad said its insane to put that much sugar I'll definitely bake these next time but less sugar. My whole packet of sugar literally is gone now because too much sugar, i had to mix it with castor sugar that I had because i ran out of granulated.\n\nThe brownies reached my expectations.
