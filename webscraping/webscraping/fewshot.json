This is for a class project, however, I wanted to advocate for the deaf community and let you know that having closed captions can be extremely helpful when it comes to watching videos, as they can allow for the viewer to better understand what is being said whenever a word is not understood by the automated captions.

Carob is basically diet chocolate, it doesn't have any of the texture chocolate does and will make anything it's added to taste bad, because it's basically edible chalk, in that it's naturally salty and has no value as a nutritional item. Also, it's naturally oily and will cause problems if not handled properly. Unless you are allergic to chocolate, avoid carob.",
